## Purpose of development

We already know most of the YGOPro/EDOPro related projects are quite obsolete and hard to contribute since they are developed in quite low level (or not-using) languages. (e.g. CoffeeScript, C/C++, etc.) we know those ecosystems will eventually occur tons of problem. so I had decided to resolve this issues in _**modern**_ and _**elegant**_ way.

so this is a native parser project for node environment. this means I want to live lazy like other webdevs ðŸ˜‚. but you would  realize that providing modules for productive languages  can have a lot of impact on improving development ecosystem of YGOPro/EDOPro.

## Installation

*Note: you should use Node with version >= 12.*

```
npm i yrp
```

or if you use [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry):

```
yarn add yrp
```

## How to use

```tsx
import { Replay } from "yrp";

// ...

// of course you can load replay from raw buffer too!
const replay = await Replay.fromFile("./target-file.yrp");
```
